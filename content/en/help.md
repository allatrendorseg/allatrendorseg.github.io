*How can you help?*

## CatHouse

Our foundation's CatHouse operates at the Pet Clinic in Buda, courtesy of Dr. Hacco Oren, so our cats are under direct medical supervision.

We operate with a constantly full house, we receive animals in distress from all over the country, for whom we are looking for responsible owners after their recovery and rehabilitation.

Our volunteers take care of the cats.

The home welcomes visitors and volunteers by prior arrangement.

We are looking for help in taking care of our rescues (feeding, cleaning, occupation, playtimes), small assembly and repair works if needed.

## Temporary Fostering

Temporary fostering plays an important role in the outcome of adopting our animals: while they learn what a sofa, love, family, toy is, their foster family helps us get to know more about our rescue cat or dog.

This makes it easier for us to choose the ideal family for adoption.

In addition, you also make it possible for us to save another animal.

In case of temporary admission, our organization continues to bear the costs (for example, medical care, food, litter, medicines) so that our volunteers have more time for what is important: caring for their temporary adoptee.

## Marketing Help

We spend a lot of time in maintanance of our social media profiles, because our online presence helps finding homes to our adoptees.

You can help in collecting, creating and managing content (descriptions, pictures, videos), so we can spend more time to care for our animals.

If you have marketing / graphic skills, or if you just feel that you would like to be our volunteer from home, feel free to [write](../contact) to us!
