*People for Animals 2013 Foundation*

Our foundation is an organization of citizen volunteers that was founded in 2013.
Our founding members have several years of animal rescue experience.
For us, animal rescue is a vocation, and we do it voluntarily in our spare time.

Our foundation aims to help animals' well-being and quality of life and to immediately rescue animals that have fallen victim to animal cruelty by cooperating with the authorities.

Furthermore, transport to a veterinarian, temporary placement, medical treatment, physical and mental rehabilitation, and their final adoption.

Introducing and enforcing correct and responsible animal husbandry and animal protection laws among the population.

We want to achieve our goals with our cooperating partners from the entire territory of Hungary.
